## Debugging 
- `inspect(table) -> string`
    - Given an input table, outputs a shallow mapping of keys to values as a string. Gives no further information on subtables.
- `inspectDepth(table) -> string`
    - Given an input table, recursively creates a string representation up to a depth of 5.
- `inspectFunction(func) -> string`
    - Given an input function, outputs details on its name, source, line of definition and number of upvalues.
- `serialize(t, indent) -> string`
    - Given an input table, creates a string containing Lua code that evaluates to the serializable part of `t`. Information may be lost, and circular references are not resolved.
- `serialize_string(s) -> string`
    - Serializes the provided string.
- `tprint(t, indent) -> string`
    - Recursively stringifies an input table into pseudo-valid Lua code, leaving non-serializable values and tables above a depth of 5 into their default string representations.
- `SMODS.deepfind(tbl, val, mode, immediate) -> table`
    - Searches for provided `val` anywhere deep within the provided `tbl`. Returns a table of finds. 
    - `mode` - `"index"`/`"i"` will have `val` compared to the indexes in the tables. `"value"`/`"v"` will have `val` compared to the values in the tables. 
    - `immediate` - Will return immediately after finding the value the first time.
- `SMODS.debug_calculation()`
    - Enables debugging of Joker calculations. 
    - Every time that `Card:calculate_joker()` is called, `G.contexts` is updated for every value within `context`.

## Number Formatting
- `round_number(num, precision) -> number`
    - Rounds the input number to a given amount of decimal places.
- `format_ui_value(value) -> string`
    - Stringifies the input if it is not a number. Otherwise return the number as it should be displayed in the UI (e.g. scientific notation).

## Randomness
- `SMODS.poll_rarity(_pool_key, _rand_key) -> string|number` 
    - Generates a random rarity for the given pool (the only vanilla pool that supports rarities is `'Joker'`). If `_rand_key` is present, use it as a seed.
- `SMODS.poll_seal(args) -> string?`
    - Checks if a seal should be generated, and generates one according to the specified arguments if so. The following arguments are supported:
    - `key` - Randomness seed for the check whether to generate a seal, defaults to `'stdseal'`.
    - `mod` - Multiplier to the base rate at which seals appear.
    - `guaranteed` - If this is `true`, always generate a seal.
    - `options` - A table of possible seals to generate. Defaults to all available seals.
    - `type_key` - Randomness seed for the roll which seal to generate.
- `SMODS.poll_enhancement(args) -> string?`
    - Checks if an enhancement should be generated, and generates one according to the specified arguments if so. The following arguments are supported: 
    - `key` - Randomness seed for the check whether to generate an enhancement, defaults to `'std_enhance'`.
    - `mod` - Multiplier to the base rate at which enhancements appear.
    - `guaranteed` - If this is `true`, always generate an enhancement.
    - `options` - A table of possible enhancements to generate. Defaults to all available enhancements.
    - `type_key` - Randomness seed for the roll which enhancement to generate.

## Mod-facing Utilities
These functions facilitate specific tasks that many mods may use but may be harder to achieve when implemented individually. Some replace base game functions to create a more usable interface.
- `SMODS.find_mod(id) -> table`
    - Returns a list of mods that either match the given mod ID or provide it, and are enabled and loaded. 
    - The result of `next(SMODS.find_mod(id))` can be used to determine if a mod is present, akin to finding cards with `SMODS.find_card`.
- `SMODS.load_file(path, id) -> function`
    - Given a path to a file in the context of the mod currently being loaded, loads the file contents and returns them as a function. If this function is called after the mod loading stage, a mod's `id` must be specified in order to find the correct file.
    - Return type is the same as [love.filesystem.load](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem.load) and [loadfile](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-loadfile).
    - Example usage: `assert(SMODS.load_file('jokers.lua'))()`
- `SMODS.juice_up_blind()`
    - Plays a 'juice up' animation on the Blind chip.
- `SMODS.change_base(card, suit, rank) -> Card?, string?`
    - Given a `Card` representing a playing card, changes the card's suit, rank, or both. Either argument may be omitted to retain the original suit or rank.
    - This function returns `nil` if it fails, with the second argument being a string with an error message. It is recommended to always wrap calls to it in `assert` so errors don't go unnoticed.
    - Examples: `assert(SMODS.change_base(card, 'Hearts'))` converts a card into Hearts. `assert(SMODS.change_base(card, nil, 'Ace'))` converts a card into an Ace. `assert(SMODS.change_base(card, 'Hearts', 'Ace'))` converts a card into an Ace of Hearts.
- `SMODS.modify_rank(card, amount) -> Card?, string?`
    - Given a `Card` representing a playing card, increases or decreases the card's rank by the specified `amount`. The rank is increased if `amount` is positive and decreased if it is negative.
    - This function returns `nil` if it fails, with the second argument being a string with an error message. It is recommended to always wrap calls to it in `assert` so errors don't go unnoticed.
    - Examples: `assert(SMODS.modify_rank(card, 1))` increases a card's rank by one, like the Strength Tarot. `assert(SMODS.modify_rank(card, -2))` decreases a card's rank by two.
- `SMODS.find_card(key, count_debuffed) -> table`
    - This function replaces `find_joker`. It operates using keys instead of names, which avoids overlap between mods.
    - Returns an array of all jokers or consumables in the player's possession with the given key. Debuffed cards count only if `count_debuffed` is true.
- `SMODS.add_card(t) -> Card`
    - This function replaces `add_joker`. It takes the same input parameters as `SMODS.create_card` (below) and additionally emplaces the generated card into its area and evaluates `add_to_deck` effects.
- `SMODS.create_card(t) -> Card`
    - This function replaces `create_card`. It provides a cleaner interface to the same functionality. The argument to this function should always be a table. The following fields are supported:
    - `set` - The card type to be generated, e.g. `'Joker'`, `'Tarot'`, `'Spectral'`
    - `area` - The card area this will be emplaced into, e.g. `G.jokers`, `G.consumeables`. Default values are determined based on `set`.
    - `legendary` - Set this to `true` to generate a card of Legendary rarity.
    - `rarity` - If this is specified, skip rarity polling and use this instead of a chance roll between 0 and 1.
        - Under vanilla conditions, values up to 0.7 indicate "Common" rarity, values above 0.7 and up to 0.95 indicate "Uncommon" rarity, and values above 0.95 indicate "Rare" rarity.
    - `skip_materialize` - If this is `true`, a `start_materialize` animation will not be shown.
    - `soulable` - If this is `true`, hidden Soul-type cards are allowed to replace the generated card. Usually, this is the case for cards generated for booster packs.
    - `key` - If this is specified, generate a card with the given key instead of the random one.
    - `key_append` - An additional RNG seeding string. This should be used to put different sources of card generation on different queues.
    - `no_edition` - If this is `true`, the generated card is guaranteed to have no randomly generated edition.
    - `edition`, `enhancement`, `seal` - Applies the specified modifier to the card.
    - `stickers` - This should be an array of sticker keys. Applies all specified stickers to the card.
- `SMODS.debuff_card(card, debuff, source)`
    - Allows manually setting and removing debuffs from cards.
    - `source` should be a unique identifier string. You must use the same source to remove a previously set debuff.
    - If `debuff` is the string `'reset'`, remove debuffs from all sources handled by this function.
    - If `debuff` is the string `'prevent_debuff'`, blocks all possible debuffs on the card until removed.
    - If `debuff` is another truthy value, set a debuff on the card.
    - If `debuff` is a falsy values, remove this debuff.
- `SMODS.recalc_debuff(card)`
    - Recalculates the debuff state of a card.
- `SMODS.merge_lists(...) -> table`
    - Takes any number of 2D arrays. Flattens the input into a 1D array that contains all elements once in the order they first appear and removes any duplicates.
    - This can be used to merge results from poker hand evaluation to create a combined hand.
- `SMODS.get_blind_amount(ante) -> number`
    - Provides score requirements for higher stages of ante scaling. If you want to implement your own scaling rules, you should modify this function.
- `SMODS.stake_from_index(index) -> string`
    - Given an index from the Stake pool, return the corresponding key, or `'error'` if it doesn't exist.
- `SMODS.smart_level_up_hand(card, hand, instant, amount)`
    - Akin to vanilla's `level_up_hand()`, but avoids uneccessary calling of `update_hand_text()`
    - `card` - If included, juices up this card during the animation
    - `hand` - Key to the hand being leveled up.
    - `instant` - Skips the level up animations.
    - `amount` - How much the poker hand is leveled. Defaults to 1.
- `SMODS.blueprint_effect(copier, copied_card, context) -> table?`
    - Helper function to copy the ability of another joker, akin to Blueprint/Brainstorm. 
    - `copier` is the card the will be copying the effect of `copied_card`, using the provided `context` table. 
    - The returned table is the calculated effect of `copied_card`, with the display card set to `copier`. 
    - Example: 
        ```lua
		calculate = function(self, card, context)
			-- This is an implementation of Brainstorm
			local other_joker = G.jokers.cards[1]
			local other_joker_ret = SMODS.blueprint_effect(other_joker, card, context)

			if other_joker_ret then
				return other_joker_ret
			end
		end
        ```
- `SMODS.has_enhancement(card, key) -> bool`
    - Returns true if the provided `card` has a specific enhancement.
- `SMODS.change_voucher_limit(mod)`
    - Modifies the Voucher shop limit by `mod`.
- `SMODS.change_booster_limit(mod)`
    - Modifies the Booster Pack shop limit by `mod`.
- `SMODS.change_free_rerolls(mod)`
    - Modifies the current amount of free shop rerolls by `mod`.
- `SMODS.shallow_copy(t) -> table`
    - Returns a shallow copy of the provided table.
- `time(func, ...) -> number`
    - Calls an input function with any given additional arguments: `func(...)` and returns the time the function took to execute in milliseconds. The return value from `func` is lost.
